Today, I feel like I've really wasted a day, but I've learned 600 episodes of Java. It's coming to an end. I can start the next chapter. I feel very tired. Why is the learning road so hard? There are still a lot of things to learn. In this morbid social environment, you will be excluded if you don't roll in, I feel that the profession of programmer is really not something that ordinary people can do. I watched a movie in the evening. I was angry about a serious case. There was something wrong with the brain and loud voice in the cinema, which made me deaf. Generally speaking, I think the movie is general, and the feeling of Hong Kong film is about to decline. On the whole, it makes sense.
